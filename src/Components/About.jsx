            Hi, my name is <b>Aravind P</b> and I am from Kannur, Kerala, India.
            I'm a <b>Full-stack web developer</b> and a final year university
            student pursuing <b>B.Tech in Computer Science</b>. <br />
            <br />
            I love to create projects with beautiful designs and put my own
            twists on it, you can check out some of my work in the projects
            section.
            <br />
            <br />I am <b>open</b> to new collaborations or work where I can
            contribute and grow. Feel free to connect with me, links are in the
            footer.
            <br />
            Apart from coding I love to make designs and do photography in my
            spare time.
